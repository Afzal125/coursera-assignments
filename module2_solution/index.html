                    with the A14 Bionic SoC, which we've already seen in the new iPad Air. The A14 Bionic is a six-core processor with a four-core GPU. Apple says its CPU and GPU are both fastest among all smartphones. The iPhone 12 has two 12-megapixel
                    wide-angle sensors, with Apple claiming that the detail will be much better in low light photos. Apple also spent some time touting its night mode, which now works on all cameras of iPhone 12, including the front camera. As for video
                    recording, the iPhone 12 gets night mode time-lapse which allows you to shoot excellent low-light videos, according to Apple.</p>

                    will be shipped without an AC adapter in the box. It comes with a USB-C to Lightning cable. The decision to remove the charger from the box was for environmental reasons.</p>
